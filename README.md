Abstract
In our study, we focus on refining and advancing the capabilities of a novel hybrid architecture, which
is already showing promise in the field. This architecture synergistically combines wavelet transform
methods with a convolutional network based on sophisticated residual blocks, integrated with the
EfficientNet model. Our mission is to meticulously improve and optimize this architecture to achieve
unparalleled accuracy in diagnosing and differentiating skin diseases, especially those with similar
presentations. We are dedicated to fine-tuning each aspect of this model, from enhancing feature
extraction and pattern recognition to increasing the overall robustness and reliability of the system. Our
goal is to provide a significantly improved tool for medical professionals, aiding in more precise and
effective diagnosis in dermatological care
